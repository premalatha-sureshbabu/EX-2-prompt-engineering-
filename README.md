# EX-2-prompt-engineering-Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test scenerios

## Introduction
Prompt engineering has become an increasingly important skill to
optimize AI-generated responses, especially with recent advances in AI- driven language models like ChatGPT. This experiment is aimed at
studying how differently ChatGPT treats two kinds of prompts: naïve
prompts, that is, broad, unstructured, and vague prompts; and basic
prompts that are clear, detailed, and structured. A systematic testing of
both prompts across several scenarios allows for an assessment of the
quality of the response, accuracy, and depth. 1. Aim of the Study
As part of this comparative analysis, we will try to find out whether
structured and precisely defined prompts lead to a higher quality of
responses from ChatGPT. In so doing, some principal issues addressed
include:
 Does ChatGPT consistently show better performance with basic
prompts?
 Are there instances when naïve prompts will get the job done?
 How does prompt clarity influence ChatGPT's answers in terms of
accuracy, completeness, and informativeness?

With the answers to these questions, the experiment intends to provide
insights into optimal prompt design strategies that would translate into
better AI interactions. 2. Methodology
2.1 Defining the Two Prompt Types
Naïve Prompts:
These are characterized by being broad, generic, and comparatively open- ended. ChatGPT is able to interpret the request freely, leading often to generic, ambiguous, or incomplete responses. For example: "Tell me something about space."
"How do I write a book?" Basic Prompts:
These, however, clarify the instructions, the context, and the constraints
so that the whole process leads to guiding ChatGPT in producing
responses. They help in getting accurate, relevant, and well-structured answers. For example: "Describe how galaxies are formed in space, concentrating on spiral
galaxies and elliptical galaxies."
"Sketch the major stages in writing a science fiction novel, including
character and plot development." 2.2Selection of Test Scenarios

Multiple scenarios with tasks built into both prompt types are selected to
test the performance of naïve prompts as well as that of basic prompts. The thirty scenarios which are tests include:
 Creative Story Generation
Naïve Prompt: "Write a short story." Basic Prompt: "Write a short science-fictional story about a time traveler
who gets stuck in the future due to a really broken time machine." Expected Outcome: In the basic prompt case, it should emerge as a more
structured and engaging with an even better defined plot story.  Answering Factual Questions
Naïve Prompt: "Tell me about climate change." Basic Prompt: "Breathe things off with the key causes and effects of
climate change on global temperatures and extreme weather events." Expected Outcome: A detailed and specification oriented response with
factual accuracy in the basic prompt case.  Summarization Task
Naïve Prompt: "Summarize this article." Basic Prompt: "Summarize the article in at most 100 words by extracting
the main arguments and conclusions thereof." Expected Outcome: A focused summary in the basic one.  Giving Advice and Recommendation
Naïve Prompt: "Give me some study tips." Basic Prompt: "Provide five study techniques for students preparing for
competitive exams focusing on time management and active recall."

Expected Outcome: More structured and actionable advice in the basic
prompt case. 3. Naive vs. Basic Prompting Explained:
Naive Prompting:
These are direct and simple requests, devoid of any contextual or specific
instructions, and depend on the model's pre-training. As a result, it may
result in non-predictable and rather unhelpful outputs. Characteristics of Naive prompts essentially have the following attributes:
 Minimal instructions encourage open-endedness.  Total omission of context or detail.  Responses could be genuinely ambiguous or somewhat relevant or
generalized.  Probably requires a follow-up question for further clarification. Examples for Naïve Prompts:
 "Tell me something about AI
 "Create a story"  "Climate change impact on the earth"  "What does Python do?" Limitations of Naïve Prompts:
 Depth is lacking in answers.  Output generated by AI has a high variance.  Can Interpolate user intent incorrectly. 4
Basic Prompting:
Here, some detailed instructions are provided along with context and/or
examples, intended to guide the model's answer more effectively and for
making better use of the model to reach the desired ends. Basic Prompts Are Characterized By:
 Clear about what it needs.  Giving context or constraints (length, format, perspective, etc.).  Reduce ambiguity while increasing answer accuracy.  It provoked answers that are better organized, detailed, and insightful. Examples of Basic Prompts:
 "Describe artificial intelligence, pointing out its major applications in
healthcare and finance."  "Develop into a short story of 500 words about an astronaut
discovering alien life on Mars."  "Explain how climate change affects rising sea levels, and present
three solutions for consideration."  "Summarize the major differences between Python and Java, focusing
on syntax, performance, and use cases."
Indeterminate Perks of Using Basic Prompts:
 Yields more specific answers that can be relevant.  Provides foresight to strengthen the quality and knowledge of content
generated by AI.  It gets rid of reliance on follow-ups in most cases. 5

 They impact answer quality.  The more basic the prompt given to ChatGPT, the better the structure
and output.  Naïve prompts might be used for general brainstorming, but they
become too vague in the case of complex queries.  The basic prompts are always far better where specificity is required.
 In a structured way, prompts are useful in minimizing biases of AI
and improving accuracy.  Well-defined prompt ensures that nothing is misinterpreted or
returned.  Users should focus on prompts that provide as much detail as possible
and are goal-oriented to optimize the performance of ChatGPT. 6.When to Use Naïve vs. Basic Prompting?
Use Naïve Prompting When:
 Exploring open-ended ideas or brainstorming.  Encouraging creative freedom for AI-generated responses.  Seeking general overviews rather than in-depth analysis. Use Basic Prompting When:
 Needing precise, fact-based answers.  Structuring content for research, writing, or professional use.  Asking for summaries, comparisons, or step-by-step guides. 7. Conclusion
We highlight prompt engineering-a point that was brought across in the
experiment-in using AI models like ChatGPT. Structured and detailed
prompts greatly improve the accuracy, depth, and usability of responses. Best Practices for Effective Prompting:
 Be Specific: Give clear commands to obtain an explicative answer.  Constrain: Limit either length, style, or content of the answer.  Context: Furnish background for the AI to understand existing
conditions.  Chunking: Rather than use broad prompts, divide requests into
smaller steps for optimized results. By following these strategies, the user can maximize the production of
effective AI-generated outputs and thus make ChatGPT a trustworthy
partner for work-from the research and creation of content to coding and
analyzing data.
